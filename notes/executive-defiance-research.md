# Research Notes: Executive Defiance and Nullification

## Key Questions

1. What are the historical precedents for executive defiance of judicial rulings?
2. What mechanisms exist (or don't exist) to enforce judicial decisions?
3. How does Worcester v. Georgia illustrate the limits of judicial power?
4. What would modern executive defiance look like?
5. How does this connect to departmentalist theory?

## Historical Examples

### Worcester v. Georgia (1832)
- Jackson's response
- Mechanisms (or lack thereof) for enforcement
- Impact on balance of powers

### Other Historical Examples
[To be filled as research progresses]

## Modern Implications

### Constitutional Mechanisms
- What can Congress do?
- What can judiciary do?
- What can states do?
- What can the people do?

### Political Realities
- Public opinion and legitimacy
- Media framing
- Partisan dynamics
- Institutional constraints

## Connection to Core Themes

### Departmentalism
- Each branch interprets independently
- No automatic enforcement of judicial rulings
- Executive duty to interpret Constitution

### Original Authority
- Constitution itself as antecedent to judicial construction
- Popular sovereignty through executive as antecedent to judicial authority
- Original intent as antecedent to precedent

### Judicial Supremacy Critique
- Worcester shows limits of judicial power
- Enforcement depends on other branches
- Structural weakness of judicial supremacy
