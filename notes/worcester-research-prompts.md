## Connection to "Antecedent to All"

Worcester v. Georgia demonstrates:
- Executive treating its own constitutional interpretation as antecedent to judicial rulings
- The Constitution itself (as executive interprets it) as antecedent to judicial construction
- Popular sovereignty (through executive) as antecedent to judicial authority
- Original authority (executive's duty to interpret) as antecedent to precedent

This case is a historical example of departmentalist thinking in action - each branch interpreting independently, with no automatic supremacy of judicial interpretation.
