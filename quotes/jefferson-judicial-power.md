# Quotes: Jefferson on Judicial Power and Constitutional Interpretation

## Jefferson's Warnings About Judicial Oligarchy

### No Constitutional Grant of Exclusive Power

> "The question whether the judges are invested with exclusive authority to decide on the constitutionality of a law has been heretofore a subject of consideration with me in the exercise of official duties. Certainly there is not a word in the Constitution which has given that power to them more than to the Executive or Legislative branches."
>
> — Thomas Jefferson to W. H. Torrance, 1815 (ME 14:303)

Context: Direct rejection of judicial supremacy; the Constitution does not assign final constitutional interpretation to the judiciary any more than to the other branches.

### Ultimate Arbiter: The People, Not the Courts

> "But the Chief Justice says, 'There must be an ultimate arbiter somewhere.' True, there must; but does that prove it is either party? The ultimate arbiter is the people of the Union, assembled by their deputies in convention, at the call of Congress or of two-thirds of the States. Let them decide to which they mean to give an authority claimed by two of their organs. And it has been the peculiar wisdom and felicity of our Constitution, to have provided this peaceable appeal, where that of other nations is at once to force."
>
> — Thomas Jefferson to William Johnson, 1823 (ME 15:451)

Context: Answers Marshall's "there must be an ultimate arbiter" with the departmentalist alternative: the people in convention, not the judiciary.

### Despotism of an Oligarchy

> "To consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions [is] a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men and not more so. They have with others the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps. Their maxim is boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem [good justice is broad jurisdiction], and their power the more dangerous as they are in office for life and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves."
>
> — Thomas Jefferson to William C. Jarvis, 28 September 1820 (ME 15:277)

Context: The classic "judicial oligarchy" warning; co-equal and co-sovereign departments as the constitutional design.

### Judiciary as Despotic Branch

> "The Constitution... meant that its coordinate branches should be checks on each other. But the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not, not only for themselves in their own sphere of action but for the Legislature and Executive also in their spheres, would make the Judiciary a despotic branch."
>
> — Thomas Jefferson to Abigail Adams, 1804 (ME 11:51)

Context: Written in the wake of Marbury (1803); judicial review over other branches' spheres makes the judiciary despotic.

### Constitution as Wax in the Hands of the Judiciary

> "In denying the right [the Supreme Court usurps] of exclusively explaining the Constitution, I go further than [others] do.... If this opinion be sound, then indeed is our Constitution a complete felo de se [act of suicide]. For intending to establish three departments, coordinate and independent, that they might check and balance one another, it has given, according to this opinion, to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for the government of the others, and to that one, too, which is unelected by and independent of the nation. For experience has already shown that the impeachment it has provided is not even a scare-crow... The Constitution on this hypothesis is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please."
>
> — Thomas Jefferson to Spencer Roane, 1819 (ME 15:212)

Context: Judicial supremacy inverts the design of coordinate departments; unelected judiciary prescribing for the others; "wax" metaphor for pliable constitutional meaning.

### Sapping and Mining the Foundations

> "This member of the Government was at first considered as the most harmless and helpless of all its organs. But it has proved that the power of declaring what the law is, ad libitum, by sapping and mining slyly and without alarm the foundations of the Constitution, can do what open force would not dare to attempt."
>
> — Thomas Jefferson to Edward Livingston, 1825 (ME 16:114)

Context: Judiciary as initially thought harmless, but its power to "declare what the law is" at will undermines the Constitution by stealth.

---

## Each Department Independent: Departmentalism

### Equal Right to Decide for Themselves

> "My construction of the Constitution is... that each department is truly independent of the others and has an equal right to decide for itself what is the meaning of the Constitution in the cases submitted to its action; and especially where it is to act ultimately and without appeal."
>
> — Thomas Jefferson to Spencer Roane, 1819 (ME 15:214)

Context: Clear statement of departmentalism: each branch interprets for itself within its sphere.

---

### No Right to Decide for the Executive

> "Nothing in the Constitution has given [the judges] a right to decide for the Executive, more than to the Executive to decide for them. Both magistrates are equally independent in the sphere of action assigned to them."
>
> — Thomas Jefferson to Abigail Adams, 1804 (ME 11:50)

Context: Mutual independence; judiciary has no constitutional authority to bind the executive.

---

### Each Department Decides Its Own Duty

> "Each of the three departments has equally the right to decide for itself what is its duty under the Constitution without regard to what the others may have decided for themselves under a similar question."
>
> — Thomas Jefferson to Spencer Roane, 1819 (ME 15:215)

Context: Departmentalism: each branch decides its own constitutional duty without being bound by the others' interpretation.

---

### The People as Corrective

> "I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society, but the people themselves: and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education. This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power."
>
> — Thomas Jefferson to William C. Jarvis, 28 September 1820 (ME 15:278)

Context: Ultimate authority and corrective for abuse lie with the people, not with the judiciary.

## Other Contemporary Critics

- **Spencer Roane** (Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals): Opposed Marshall's view that the U.S. Supreme Court was the final arbiter in federal and constitutional matters; argued the Constitution did not give the Court authority to review state court decisions on federal questions. Wrote pseudonymous essays as "Hampden" after *McCulloch v. Maryland* (1819). Jefferson corresponded with Roane and shared his departmentalist view.
