# Author Intent & Political Framing

## Core Mission
Analyzing the U.S. Constitution from original authority—the text itself and founding-era understanding—rather than modern judicial precedent. The work strips back constitutional doctrine to its textual and historical roots, examining what the document actually says and what the framers intended, not what courts have subsequently constructed. This is principled without being partisan, rooted without being reactionary, and serious about liberty without collapsing into slogans.

## Key Themes
- **Original Authority Over Precedent** - The Constitution itself, not judicial rulings, is the highest law. Reject *stare decisis* as primary authority; reason from text and historical context.
- **Departmentalism vs. Judicial Supremacy** - Each branch has independent duty to interpret Constitution within its domain. Reject Marbury v. Madison's self-declared judicial supremacy.
- **Constitution as Moral Architecture** - The Constitution reflects assumptions about human nature, power, and restraint
- **Judicial Oligarchy** - Echo Jefferson's warnings about judiciary becoming a "super branch" that consolidates power
- **Ordered Liberty vs. Abstract Freedom** - Liberty understood as self-restraint within moral and communal limits, not autonomy detached from responsibility
- **Human Nature & Power** - Deep skepticism of concentrated power (kings, mobs, bureaucracies, experts, judges) and the need for checks and balances
- **Rights Paired with Duties** - Rights presume responsibility and self-restraint; liberty requires virtue
- **Pre-Political Foundations** - Conscience, natural law, and moral truth exist prior to and beyond the state's rightful control
- **Limited Government** - The republic as referee, not redeemer; law as boundary, not therapy
- **Federalism & Subsidiarity** - Problems solved at the lowest competent level; wisdom of decentralized error
- **Originalist 14th Amendment** - Narrow reading of Citizenship Clause; "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" may not create unconditional birthright citizenship
- **Popular Sovereignty** - Erosion through judicial overreach; the people's authority as antecedent to judicial construction
- **Constitutional Amnesia** - How forms persist while underlying philosophy is replaced; modern doctrine divorced from original text and intent

## Target Audience
- Thoughtful readers seeking to understand constitutional principles beyond partisan frames
- People interested in first principles and foundational questions
- Those who want careful thinking without tribal triggers
- Readers open to reflection rather than immediate agreement

## What You're NOT Doing
- Not interested in what Supreme Court *has ruled* unless analyzing how it diverged from Constitution
- Not persuaded by practical justifications (stability, precedent, modern necessity) unless weighed against original framework
- Not treating judicial precedent (*stare decisis*) as primary authority
- Not accepting judicial supremacy as legitimate constitutional arrangement
- Not signaling modern partisan alignment
- Not demanding agreement or triggering tribal responses
- Not collapsing into slogans or abstract freedom talk
- Not treating the Constitution as merely a legal document
- Not assuming government can manufacture virtue or eliminate ambition

## Political Lens
**Radical Originalist / Departmentalist / Jeffersonian Framework:**
- **Original Authority** - Constitution's text and framers' intent as antecedent to all judicial interpretation
- **Departmentalism** - Each branch interprets independently; no branch has final say
- **Rejection of Judicial Supremacy** - Marbury v. Madison distorted constitutional balance; judiciary became "super branch"
- **Jeffersonian Warnings** - Judicial oligarchy threatens popular sovereignty
- **Textual and Historical Roots** - What document actually says and what framers intended, not what courts constructed
- The Constitution as moral architecture for fallen but dignified creatures
- Ordered liberty that acknowledges human capacity for both greatness and corruption
- Pre-political rights (especially conscience) that precede the state
- Limited government that preserves conditions for liberty without manufacturing outcomes
- Federalism and subsidiarity as recognition of human scale and accountability
- Process and principle must align; structure without spirit is hollow
- Popular sovereignty as antecedent to judicial power

## Posture
- **Doors, not declarations** - Opening rooms for careful thinking rather than triggering alarms
- **Speaking carefully is not cowardice** - Clarity sometimes requires restraint rather than confrontation
- **Teaching without triggering** - Inviting reflection rather than demanding agreement
- **Persuasion in an age of sorting** - Avoiding ideological labeling that short-circuits listening

## Substack Goals
- Build engaged readership through substantive, principled analysis
- Provide careful thinking about first principles from original authority
- Create series that explore constitutional questions systematically
- Maintain consistent voice: principled, rooted, serious about liberty
- Invite reflection on foundational questions about human nature, power, and ordered liberty
- Strip back modern doctrine to textual and historical roots
- Examine consequences of rejecting judicial supremacy
- Explore departmentalist alternative to judicial review

## Constitutional Analysis Approach
- Start with Constitution's text, not Supreme Court rulings
- Quote founding-era sources (Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, Convention/ratification debates)
- Label modern court rulings as **post-constitutional interpretations**
- Surface implications for today's legal/political structure, but anchor in original compact
- When something is "made up," it lacks grounding in constitutional text or original intent (not invented from thin air, but unmoored from authority)
- Evaluate what Constitution *actually authorizes* based on language, structure, and founding-era understanding
