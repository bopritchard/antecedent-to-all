# Terminology Guide

## Key Terms (Define Once, Use Consistently)

**Ordered Liberty:**
- Use when: Distinguishing founding-era understanding of liberty from modern abstract freedom
- Definition: Liberty that operates within moral and communal limits, paired with self-restraint and responsibility
- Avoid: Using interchangeably with "autonomy" or "freedom" without qualification

**Pre-Political:**
- Use when: Describing rights, conscience, or moral truth that exists prior to the state
- Definition: That which exists before and beyond the state's rightful control
- Avoid: Confusing with "apolitical" (pre-political acknowledges political implications)

**Moral Architecture:**
- Use when: Describing the Constitution as reflecting assumptions about human nature and power
- Definition: The underlying framework of assumptions about mankind that makes the constitutional system coherent
- Avoid: Reducing to mere "values" or "principles" without the architectural metaphor

**Checks and Balances as Anthropology:**
- Use when: Explaining that separation of powers reflects a confession about human nature
- Definition: The structure reveals assumptions about why good intentions are insufficient safeguards
- Avoid: Treating as mere procedural cleverness

**Ambition Counteracting Ambition:**
- Use when: Explaining why the founders assumed ambition would shift, not disappear
- Definition: The recognition that ambition is constant and must be channeled, not eliminated
- Avoid: Suggesting ambition can be eliminated through better systems

**Republic as Referee, Not Redeemer:**
- Use when: Distinguishing limited government from government as moral savior
- Definition: Government preserves conditions for liberty rather than manufacturing virtue, equality, or happiness
- Avoid: Implying government has no moral role (it has a limited one)

**Subsidiarity:**
- Use when: Explaining why problems should be solved at the lowest competent level
- Definition: The principle that authority should be exercised at the most local level capable of handling it
- Avoid: Using without explaining the term (it's not commonly known)

**Constitutional Amnesia:**
- Use when: Describing how forms persist while underlying philosophy is replaced
- Definition: Keeping constitutional structure while abandoning the spirit that animated it
- Avoid: Suggesting this is always intentional (often it's drift)

**Departmentalism:**
- Use when: Describing the view that each branch has independent duty to interpret Constitution
- Definition: Each branch interprets Constitution within its own domain; no branch has final say
- Avoid: Confusing with "judicial review" (departmentalism rejects judicial supremacy)

**Judicial Supremacy:**
- Use when: Critiquing Marbury v. Madison's self-declared judicial authority
- Definition: The claim that judiciary has final, binding authority over constitutional interpretation
- Avoid: Treating as legitimate constitutional arrangement (it's a post-constitutional interpretation)

**Original Authority:**
- Use when: Distinguishing Constitution's text and framers' intent from judicial precedent
- Definition: The Constitution itself as antecedent to all judicial interpretation
- Avoid: Confusing with "originalism" as mere interpretive method (this is about authority, not method)

**Post-Constitutional Interpretations:**
- Use when: Referring to Supreme Court rulings that diverge from original text/intent
- Definition: Judicial constructions that lack grounding in constitutional text or original intent
- Avoid: Treating as authoritative simply because courts have ruled

**Stare Decisis:**
- Use when: Rejecting precedent as primary authority
- Definition: The doctrine of following precedent; rejected as primary authority in favor of original text
- Avoid: Treating as binding when it conflicts with original authority

**Subject to the Jurisdiction Thereof:**
- Use when: Discussing 14th Amendment Citizenship Clause
- Definition: The qualifying phrase that may limit birthright citizenship; requires narrow, originalist reading
- Avoid: Assuming it creates unconditional birthright citizenship without examining original intent

## Preferred Language
- Use "ordered liberty" instead of "freedom" when discussing founding-era concepts
- Prefer "pre-political" over "natural" when describing rights that precede the state
- Use "moral architecture" to describe constitutional assumptions, not just "values"
- Prefer "referee" metaphor for limited government rather than "minimal" or "small"
- Use "checks and balances as anthropology" to emphasize human nature insights
- Use "original authority" or "original text and intent" instead of "originalism" (emphasizes authority, not just method)
- Prefer "post-constitutional interpretations" over "Supreme Court rulings" when critiquing judicial construction
- Use "departmentalism" to describe alternative to judicial supremacy
- Prefer "Constitution itself" over "constitutional law" (distinguishes text from judicial construction)

## Political Framing Terms
- **Fallen but dignified creatures** - Human capacity for both greatness and corruption
- **Process without principle** - Constitutional forms without underlying philosophy
- **Liberty reframed as permission** - Shift from natural law restraint to institutional grant
- **Administrative power vs. representative rule** - Bureaucracy challenging accountable government
- **No national church, not no moral foundation** - Distinction between establishment and moral influence
- **Judicial oligarchy** - Jefferson's warning about judiciary becoming "super branch"
- **Made up** (constitutional sense) - Lacks grounding in constitutional text or original intent (not invented from thin air, but unmoored from authority)
- **Original compact** - The Constitution as agreement between people and government, antecedent to judicial construction

## Terms to Avoid
- "The system" (too vague; prefer specific institutions or structures)
- "Establishment" (too loaded and ambiguous)
- "Narrative" (prefer "framing" or "understanding")
- "Autonomy" without qualification (prefer "ordered liberty" or "autonomy within limits")
- Partisan labels that short-circuit listening

## Substack-Specific Terms
- Define "subsidiarity" on first use
- Explain "pre-political" when introducing the concept
- Provide context for "ordered liberty" vs. modern "freedom"
- Clarify "moral architecture" as distinct from mere "values"
- Use accessible language while maintaining precision
