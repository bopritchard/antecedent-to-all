# You Might Be a Christian Nationalist
*But the shoe fits the other foot*

You know the bit. Jeff Foxworthy made a career out of "You might be a redneck if..." It's a formula: take a category, list some characteristics, and let the audience fill in the rest. Simple, effective, and it works because we all understand the pattern.

So here's the political version: If you're a Jesus follower and hold to what some would refer to as conservative political principles, then you are—you guessed it—a Christian nationalist.

At least, that's the shortcut definition. The term has virtually no meaning except that we all understand it is a pejorative, and it can be wielded at any time to label someone with whom you have disagreement.

But here's the rub: the shoe fits the other foot.

## The Shortcut Definition

The term "Christian nationalist" functions as a label, not a definition. If you are a Christian and hold conservative political principles, you are a Christian nationalist. That's the formula. No further analysis required. It's like a theological version of "if the shoe fits"—except the shoe is whatever size you need it to be.

The term has become a catch-all pejorative, useful for dismissing arguments without engaging them. It signals tribal alignment more than it describes actual positions. We all understand it means something bad, even if we can't say precisely what. It's the political equivalent of calling someone a "heretic" but with less precision and more Twitter.

But definitions matter. And if we're going to use the term, we should apply it accurately. Otherwise, we're just playing theological Mad Libs.

David French, writing in The New York Times, attempts a definition: "The problem with Christian nationalism isn't with Christian participation in politics but rather the belief that there should be Christian primacy in politics and law."

French is intentionally abstract with his language so that only the people he disagrees with fit into his definition. "Christian primacy" sounds ominous, but what does it actually mean? It's vague enough to exclude his own positions while including everyone he wants to label.

But here's where it gets interesting: if Christian nationalism means seeking "Christian primacy in politics and law," then demanding state action based on biblical commands is exactly that—seeking to make Christian values primary in law and policy, regardless of whether you call it "primacy" or "just following the Bible." French's abstraction doesn't protect him from his own definition.

## Two Different Kingdoms

I have been called this term. But I hold an understanding that sees the functions of the nation-state as wholly different from the Kingdom of God.

That's not to say they should be opposed. But their constituency is different. Their roles and prescribed duties are different. The nation-state exists to preserve conditions for liberty, to restrain injustice, to function as referee. The Kingdom of God exists to redeem, to transform, to function as redeemer.

What are the consequences of mixing them? When we confuse the two kingdoms, we ask the state to do what it cannot do—to redeem, to transform, to function as redeemer. We offload the church's duties onto institutions that cannot perform them. We ask the referee to score the winning goal. Wrong job, wrong skills, wrong outcome. And we force non-kingdom people to fund and participate in kingdom work, which is exactly what Christian nationalism does.

This is what the left would call "separation of church and state," though I do not believe what they believe on that topic. The phrase comes from a personal letter of Thomas Jefferson, not a constitutional principle. No state church? Yes, we all understand. We're not going to repeat the failures of the crown. But "separation of church and state" as the left uses it is a contrivance, not a constitutional requirement. It's like citing a text message as constitutional law—technically it's a document, but that's where the similarities end.

John Adams wrote that "our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other." This was his opinion, not canon, but instructive nonetheless. The Constitution assumes virtue; it doesn't manufacture it. It reflects assumptions about human nature that precede the document itself.

The Constitution was written for people capable of greatness and corruption simultaneously. It structures checks and balances as a confession about human nature—why good intentions are insufficient safeguards. Government is referee, not redeemer.

## Immigration Enforcement: Who Invokes Scripture?

There are many applications of this confusion between the two kingdoms that we'll cover in later articles, but the immigration one is hot now. Let's investigate the claims around legal and illegal immigration. I know of no pro-enforcement person who claims biblical authority or mandate in their argument. Enforcement arguments typically rest on constitutional authority, national sovereignty, rule of law, and practical considerations. You know, the boring stuff that actually matters.

With the exception, of course, being that over the previous administration there is no accounting for the untold amount of human misery that was created by our exploitative open border policies that empowered human traffickers, abuse, rape, death, lost children. That should have been a universal recognition of the situational causes that were created—and I believe on purpose—by that non-enforcement of law. But apparently, human trafficking is less important than citing the right Bible verse.

But I do see an endless parade of the left, Christian and not alike, constantly invoking scripture. My favorite examples are the texts from Exodus. It's like they discovered the Old Testament last Tuesday and decided it's now a policy manual.

They cite "You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt" (Exodus 22:20, 23:9) and "The same law applies to the native and to the foreigner who resides among you" (Exodus 12:49). Strangers are to be included in social provisions, protected from exploitation, treated with justice.

My social media is filled on a daily basis from many of my Christian friends who are invoking scripture to make their case for the state doing its duties as the state and the protector of its people. They are sorely confused. It's like watching someone try to use a recipe for bread to fix a car—same book, wrong chapter, completely different purpose.

But here's the thing: caring for strangers is not the job of the state. It's the job of the church. It's the job of individual believers. It's the job of the community of faith. The state's job is to preserve conditions for liberty, to restrain injustice, to function as referee. Caring for strangers, welcoming the vulnerable, practicing hospitality—these are kingdom duties, not state duties.

Under our form of representative government, we elected representatives to write laws and have them equally enforced. That's the state's job. And there's a natural law argument here: a nation-state protecting its boundaries is deeply rooted. It's antecedent to all positive law. The right of a political community to control its borders, to determine who enters and who stays, is fundamental to what a state is. This isn't a modern invention or a policy preference—it's what states do. They protect their people by controlling their boundaries. That's not Christian nationalism. That's just what states are for.

Context is king, everyone. But aside from the fact that the forms of government and situation bear no resemblance to one another—ancient theocratic Israel under God's direct rule versus modern secular nation-states—is the mere introduction of these texts around public policy an appeal to scripture? And more importantly, even if these passages applied to modern states (they don't), they're still instructions to God's people, not commands to the state.

If citing Exodus to demand state action on immigration isn't an appeal to scripture for public policy, what is? A really long way of saying "because the Bible says so"? But the Bible doesn't say the state should do this. It says God's people should do this. This is not the job of the state.

## The Real Question: Who Is the Christian Nationalist?

These are good and necessary instructions for God's people. Christians should hold them dearly and diligently practice them. We should care for strangers, not oppress them, include the vulnerable, practice hospitality.

The New Testament reinforces this. Jesus tells his disciples that caring for "the least of these" is caring for him (Matthew 25:31-46). James writes that "religion that is pure and undefiled" includes visiting "orphans and widows in their affliction" (James 1:27). John writes that if we see a brother in need and close our hearts, "how does God's love abide in him?" (1 John 3:17-18). Paul instructs believers to "do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith" (Galatians 6:10).

These are instructions for God's people. They are commands to the church, to individual believers, to the community of faith.

But how and where did you get the idea that they were to be offloaded onto the state to perform? This is not the job of the state. And by extension, that you force other people—non-kingdom people—to be compelled to fund and participate in them? Did I miss the verse that says "render unto Caesar the things that are God's, and also make Caesar do the things that are God's"?

Why are these progressives hell-bent on taking their personal responsibilities as kingdom inhabitants and pushing them upstream to the state to manage? Every single one of these people has the opportunity to sponsor a foreigner. There are a multitude of charities that facilitate this very work—if you need suggestions, I'll provide them. Why don't you put your money where your mouth is? You can sponsor from afar. You can sponsor H1B and work visas. You can personally make this change and difference in someone's life. Do it.

Why are you seeking to compel, by taxation and legal mandates and not to mention civic disruption, your neighbors as citizens of the nation-state to do your work and your duty? This all reeks of self-serving sanctimonious virtue signaling.

You who are reading this, who feels so strongly—put down your protest sign. Stop blocking traffic. Knock off your annoying social media posts meant to signal your virtue and chastise your neighbors. Go and personally do the work meant for you to do. Open your checkbook and secure a better life for someone in El Salvador.

The Exodus passages were given to Israel as a theocratic nation under God's direct rule. The "stranger" referred to resident aliens who lived among Israelites, not modern immigrants. These were covenant laws for God's people, not civil laws for secular states. It's the difference between instructions for your family and instructions for your neighbor's family—same book, different audience.

The New Testament passages are addressed to believers, to the church, to individual disciples. They are commands to personal responsibility, to ecclesial action, not to government mandates. Jesus didn't say "go and make the government do this." He said "go and do this." This is not the job of the state.

Where is the biblical mandate to use state power to enforce these commands? Where is the instruction to compel non-believers to fund and participate in the church's duties? I'm looking, but all I see are instructions to the church, not to Congress. This is not the job of the state.

## Who Is Trying to Use State Power to Enforce Biblical Commands?

The real Christian nationalist is the one trying to use state power to enforce biblical commands—addressed to a particular people.

If Christian nationalism means using the state to enforce religious values, or seeking "Christian primacy in politics and law" as French defines it, then those who demand state action based on Exodus passages are the Christian nationalists. Those who cite Matthew 25 to demand government welfare programs are the Christian nationalists. Those who use James 1:27 to argue for state-funded care are the Christian nationalists. They may not realize it, but they're seeking Christian primacy in law and policy. Congratulations—you played yourself.

The nation-state and Kingdom of God have different roles. The state cannot and should not perform the church's duties. This is not the job of the state. When we offload the church's responsibilities onto the state, we confuse the two kingdoms. We ask the state to do what it cannot do—to redeem, to transform, to function as redeemer. It's like asking a referee to score the winning goal. Wrong job, wrong skills, wrong outcome. This is not the job of the state.

The state exists to preserve conditions for liberty, to restrain injustice, to function as referee. The church exists to redeem, to transform, to function as redeemer. These are different constituencies, different roles, different duties. One keeps the game fair, the other changes the players. Both are necessary, but they're not the same thing.

You might be a Christian nationalist if you're trying to use state power to enforce biblical commands. You might be a Christian nationalist if you're demanding that the state perform the church's duties. You might be a Christian nationalist if you're compelling non-kingdom people to fund and participate in kingdom work. If this sounds like you, don't worry—there's probably a Facebook group for that.

The irony is that those who most loudly accuse others of Christian nationalism are often the ones most guilty of it. It's the theological version of "methinks the lady doth protest too much."

## Conclusion

The term "Christian nationalist" has become a meaningless pejorative, useful for tribal signaling but not for actual analysis. But if we're going to use it, we should apply it accurately. Otherwise, we're just throwing theological darts blindfolded.

Christian nationalism, properly understood, means using state power to enforce religious values. It means demanding that the state perform the church's duties. It means compelling non-kingdom people to fund and participate in kingdom work.

By that definition—whether we use French's "Christian primacy in politics and law" or the simpler "using state power to enforce biblical commands"—those who cite Exodus to demand state action on immigration are the Christian nationalists. Those who cite Matthew 25 to demand government welfare are the Christian nationalists. Those who use biblical commands to argue for state enforcement are the Christian nationalists. They're seeking Christian primacy in law, even if they don't call it that. The irony is delicious, if you have a taste for theological paradox.

The nation-state and Kingdom of God have different roles. The state is referee, not redeemer. The church is redeemer, not referee. When we confuse these roles, we ask the state to do what it cannot do, and we offload the church's duties onto institutions that cannot perform them. It's like asking a plumber to perform surgery—same building, different expertise. This is not the job of the state.

You might be a Christian nationalist. But the shoe fits the other foot. And if you're wearing it, you might want to check which foot it's on.
