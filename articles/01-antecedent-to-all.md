# Antecedent to All

There exists something that comes before power, binds power, and is not created by power.

This is not a slogan. It is not a modern invention. It is a juridical assertion about order—a claim that law, obligation, and limit do not begin with power, but judge it.

## The Title: Antecedent to All

This is not a quote. It is not a slogan. It is a juridical compression of a natural law claim that appears throughout founding-era writing.

James Otis, in 1764, wrote that natural rights are "prior to, and independent of, all government." Samuel Adams and others used similar formulations: "antecedent to government," "prior to civil authority," "before all human law." The idea appears across natural law scholarship: obligations antecedent to positive law, rights antecedent to the state, moral limits antecedent to sovereignty.

But "Antecedent to All" as a fixed phrase does not exist in the historical record. It is a naming of the claim, not a quotation of it.

*Antecedent* means prior in authority and existence. *To all* means not merely to statutes or rulers, but to every downstream form of power. Together, they name the claim that something binds us before we decide anything—that law, obligation, and limit do not begin with power, but judge it.

This is not foundational in the descriptive sense. It is legal, hierarchical, and adjudicative. It asserts that law grounded in nature necessarily precedes political authority—that human law is valid only insofar as it accords with what comes before it.

In constitutional terms, this means the Constitution itself—its text and original intent—is antecedent to all judicial interpretation. Popular sovereignty is antecedent to judicial power. Original authority is antecedent to precedent.

## My Approach

I analyze the Constitution from original authority—the text itself and founding-era understanding—rather than modern judicial precedent. This means starting with what the document actually says and what the framers intended, not what courts have subsequently constructed.

The concept of "antecedent to all" shapes this approach in three ways.

First, the Constitution's text and original intent are antecedent to all judicial interpretation. The original compact is antecedent to all modern doctrine. What the document says and what the framers intended are antecedent to what courts have constructed.

Second, popular sovereignty is antecedent to judicial power. The people's authority, exercised through elected representatives and the executive, is antecedent to judicial construction. The original compact between people and government is antecedent to judicial supremacy.

Third, original authority is antecedent to precedent. Founding-era understanding is antecedent to post-constitutional interpretations. The framers' vision is antecedent to judicial oligarchy.

This lens reveals that much of what passes for constitutional law is actually post-constitutional construction—judicial interpretations that lack grounding in the constitutional text or original intent. It shows how forms can persist while underlying philosophy is replaced, how structure can remain while spirit is abandoned.

I reject judicial precedent (*stare decisis*) as primary authority. The Constitution—not prior court rulings—is the highest law of the land. I believe *Marbury v. Madison* distorted the constitutional balance of power by giving the judiciary a self-declared supremacy over constitutional interpretation. I affirm a departmentalist view: each branch has an independent duty to interpret the Constitution within its own domain.

## Toward the Body Politic

This framework impacts my view of the body politic by emphasizing what binds power rather than what power creates. It reveals that rights exist prior to the state and beyond its rightful control. It shows that the Constitution reflects assumptions about human nature, power, and restraint that precede the document itself.

The republic exists to preserve conditions for liberty, not to manufacture virtue, equality, or happiness. Law functions as a boundary that restrains injustice, not as a tool to correct every social imbalance. Government is referee, not redeemer.

This raises questions about how we've drifted from original understanding—how judicial supremacy has replaced departmental interpretation, how precedent has replaced original authority, how independence claims have replaced democratic accountability. It asks what happens when we forget what's antecedent.

When the state begins to define moral truth rather than protect the space for moral disagreement, it inverts the founding logic of liberty. When we treat rights as granted rather than pre-existing, we misunderstand the relationship between power and what binds it.

The Constitution was written for people capable of greatness and corruption simultaneously. This tension explains both its brilliance and its fragility. It assumes ambition will never disappear, only shift locations. It structures checks and balances not as procedural cleverness, but as a confession about human nature—why good intentions are insufficient safeguards.

## What to Expect

In future articles, you'll find careful analysis of constitutional questions from this foundation. I'll explore topics like:

- The legitimacy and consequences of judicial review
- The true scope of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause
- The original distribution of constitutional powers between federal and state governments
- Departmentalism vs. judicial supremacy
- The erosion of popular sovereignty through judicial overreach
- Executive authority and democratic accountability
- How modern doctrine has diverged from original understanding

The foundational concept of "antecedent to all" will appear throughout as a lens for evaluating claims. When I ask whether something is constitutionally legitimate, I'm asking whether it has grounding in what's antecedent—the text, original intent, and natural law principles that bind power.

Themes that will emerge include: original authority over precedent, democratic accountability over independence claims, unitary executive over bureaucratic insulation, and the recognition that much of modern constitutional law represents drift from original understanding.

I'm not interested in what the Supreme Court *has ruled* unless we're analyzing how it diverged from the Constitution. I want to evaluate what the Constitution *actually authorizes*, based on its language, structure, and founding-era understanding. I am not persuaded by practical justifications like stability, precedent, or modern necessity unless weighed against the original framework of constitutional governance.

## Conclusion

*Antecedent to All* names the claim that law, obligation, and limit do not begin with power, but judge it. This is not about who we are, but about what binds us before we decide anything.

In constitutional terms, it means the Constitution itself—its text and original intent—is antecedent to all judicial interpretation. Popular sovereignty is antecedent to judicial power. Original authority is antecedent to precedent.

This is the foundation for everything that follows. It is the lens through which I analyze constitutional questions, the standard against which I evaluate claims, and the principle that guides my approach to the body politic.

If this resonates, you'll find here careful thinking about first principles, rigorous analysis of constitutional questions, and arguments grounded in original authority rather than modern construction. Not partisan signaling, but principled analysis. Not reactionary nostalgia, but rooted understanding. Serious about liberty without collapsing into slogans.

The work is principled without being partisan, rooted without being reactionary, and serious about liberty without collapsing into slogans. Think of these as doors rather than declarations. Each article opens a room where careful thinking can happen, without immediately triggering tribal alarms.

Welcome to the work ahead.
