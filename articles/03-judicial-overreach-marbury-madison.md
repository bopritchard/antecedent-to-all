# Judicial Overreach and the Cult of Marbury

*Marbury v. Madison* is taught as the cornerstone of American constitutional law—the case that established judicial review and made the Supreme Court the arbiter of what is constitutional. We treat it with something approaching reverence. One branch of government decided it had the final word on the meaning of the Constitution, and for over two hundred years we have largely accepted that claim. How did that happen? And why has the alternative—that each branch was meant to interpret the Constitution independently—been so thoroughly forgotten?

This article is about judicial overreach: not this or that bad decision, but the premise that the judiciary is the ultimate arbiter of constitutional meaning. It is about *Marbury v. Madison*, the decision that enshrined that premise. It is about the strongly rooted idea that each branch was supposed to interpret the Constitution for itself, and about what we lose when we forget it.

## What Marbury Actually Did

In 1803, William Marbury and several others had been appointed justices of the peace in the District of Columbia by President John Adams. Their commissions were signed and sealed but not delivered before Thomas Jefferson took office. Jefferson instructed his Secretary of State, James Madison, to withhold the commissions. Marbury sued in the Supreme Court, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel delivery.

Marbury invoked the Court's original jurisdiction under Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which authorized the Court to issue such writs. Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion did two things. First, he held that Section 13 had unconstitutionally expanded the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction beyond what Article III allows. Article III gives the Court original jurisdiction only in cases affecting ambassadors and those in which a state is a party. Congress could not add to that list. So Section 13 was void. Second, and decisively, Marshall announced that it is "emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is," and that a legislative act contrary to the Constitution is not law. The Court therefore refused to apply the statute and declined to issue the writ. Marbury lost.

The practical result was a retreat: the Court did not order Jefferson to do anything he might defy. The doctrinal result was a revolution. The Court had claimed the power to declare what the Constitution means and to refuse to apply acts of Congress it deemed unconstitutional. That is the birth of **judicial supremacy** as we know it—the claim that the judiciary has final, binding authority over constitutional interpretation for the whole government.

## It Was Not Received as Obvious Truth

*Marbury* was highly criticized at the time. Jefferson was not alone in seeing it as a usurpation.

Jefferson insisted that "there is not a word in the Constitution which has given that power to them more than to the Executive or Legislative branches." He warned that treating the judges as "the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions" was "a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy." Judges, he wrote, have "the same passions for party, for power" as other men; their power is "the more dangerous as they are in office for life and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control." The Constitution, he argued, "has erected no such single tribunal"; it "has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves."

To Spencer Roane he put it sharply: if the judiciary alone could prescribe rules for the other departments, then the Constitution would be "a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please." To Abigail Adams he wrote that giving the judges the right to decide what is constitutional "not only for themselves in their own sphere of action but for the Legislature and Executive also in their spheres" would "make the Judiciary a despotic branch."

How did one branch get to decide it had the final word? How convenient for that branch. The Court was not implementing a clear constitutional design; it was asserting a role that the Constitution had not given it and that its contemporaries recognized as a threat to the balance of powers.

## The Rooted Alternative: Departmentalism

The alternative has a name: **departmentalism**. It is the view that each branch of government has an independent duty to interpret the Constitution within its own domain. No branch holds the last word for the others. The judiciary says what the law is *for purposes of the cases before it*; the executive and the legislature have the same duty to uphold the Constitution in *their* spheres, and they are not bound by the Court's say-so when they believe the Court is wrong.

Jefferson stated it plainly: "Each of the three departments has equally the right to decide for itself what is its duty under the Constitution without regard to what the others may have decided for themselves under a similar question." And: "Nothing in the Constitution has given [the judges] a right to decide for the Executive, more than to the Executive to decide for them. Both magistrates are equally independent in the sphere of action assigned to them."

When Marshall said there must be an "ultimate arbiter somewhere," Jefferson replied that the ultimate arbiter is "the people of the Union, assembled by their deputies in convention"—not the Supreme Court. The Constitution had provided a peaceable appeal to the people; it had not made the judiciary the sole interpreter for the entire government.

This view was not eccentric. It reflected a strongly rooted understanding of coordinate branches and of the dangers of concentrating interpretive authority in one unelected body. The framers had rejected a council of revision that would have given the judiciary a share in reviewing legislation before it took effect. At the Convention, Madison had cautioned that the right of expounding the Constitution "in cases not of a judiciary nature" ought not to be given to the judicial department. Hamilton in *Federalist* 78 described the judiciary as "the weakest of the three departments of power," exercising "neither force nor will, but merely judgment." The Anti-Federalist Brutus had warned that the Supreme Court would be "exalted above all other power in the government, and subject to no control." Marbury did exactly what Brutus feared.

## The Schoolhouse Catechism

Many of us were taught a tidy story: Congress makes the laws, the president enforces the laws, and the court interprets the laws. It sounds like a division of labor. In practice it has become something else—a claim that the court has the *final* say on what the Constitution means and therefore on what the other branches may do. "Interprets the laws" slides into "decides for everyone what is constitutional." That is not a neutral description of the framers' design; it is the normalization of judicial supremacy.

Once that slide is accepted, we rarely ask: who checks the judiciary? The executive can veto; Congress can impeach and legislate. But if the Court has the last word on constitutionality, what check do we have on the Court? Impeachment has been used almost never to remove judges for their rulings; Jefferson called it "not even a scare-crow." Congress can strip or limit the Court's appellate jurisdiction under Article III's Exceptions Clause, but that power is used sparingly and is contested. The real check, if we take the original design seriously, is that the other branches need not treat the Court as supreme. They have their own duty to uphold the Constitution. They may, in good faith, interpret it differently and act on that interpretation—not as lawlessness, but as coordinate construction. That is what departmentalism affirms. The "check" on the judiciary is the refusal to treat it as the single arbiter.

## A Modern Application

Consider a case where a court orders the executive to return a deported person to the United States. The executive believes the removal was lawful under the Constitution and federal law. Under judicial supremacy, the executive is supposed to obey the court's order. Under departmentalism, the executive has an independent duty to interpret the Constitution and the statutes. If the executive concludes that the court has overstepped—that the matter is within the executive's constitutional authority over immigration and enforcement, and that the court's order has no proper basis—then the executive may refuse. Not as defiance of "the law," but as a different, good-faith interpretation of what the law and the Constitution require. Tell the court, in effect, that this is none of their business: it falls within the executive's sphere, and the executive will act according to its own constitutional judgment.

I am not arguing that the executive should ignore every adverse ruling. I am arguing that the premise that the court always has the final word is itself the problem. Once we accept that each branch interprets the Constitution within its own domain, the executive is not obliged to treat a court order as binding when the executive, in the exercise of its own duty, concludes that the court has wrongly invaded the executive's constitutional authority. That is not chaos; it is coordinate interpretation. It is what the design of co-equal departments implies.

## Has Marbury Ever Been Substantively Challenged?

Yes. Marbury has been **contested** and **defied**; it has never been formally overruled.

**Jefferson and his allies** rejected it from the start. Jefferson's correspondence is a sustained critique of judicial supremacy and a defense of departmental interpretation. Spencer Roane, the influential Virginia judge, opposed Marshall's vision of a Supreme Court as final arbiter and argued that the Court lacked authority to impose its constitutional views on the states and the other branches.

**Andrew Jackson and *Worcester v. Georgia* (1832):** The Court held that Georgia's laws against the Cherokee were invalid. Jackson's response—whether he said "John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it" in those words or not—was in substance to leave the decision unenforced. The judiciary had no army. The executive did not comply. The case illustrates a structural truth: judicial review has no automatic enforcement. The Court depends on the political branches. When the executive or the states refuse to treat the Court's ruling as binding, the Court has no recourse.

**Abraham Lincoln and *Dred Scott* (1857):** Lincoln explicitly rejected the idea that Supreme Court decisions on constitutional matters were binding on the President and Congress. Political actors, sworn to uphold the Constitution, were not obligated to accept what they believed were erroneous and harmful rulings. Lincoln's departmentalist stance was central to his rise and to his presidency.

So Marbury has been challenged—by the executive, by political leaders, and by scholars who defend departmentalism or coordinate construction. What has not happened is a formal overruling. The Court has never renounced its claim to supremacy. The culture of deference—treating the Court as the final arbiter—has endured. That is a choice we have made, not a necessity imposed by the Constitution.

## What Was the Supreme Court Originally For?

Article III gives the federal judiciary power over "Cases" and "Controversies" of specified kinds: those arising under the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties; cases affecting ambassadors; admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; controversies between states, between a state and citizens of another state, and so on. The Supreme Court's **original** jurisdiction—cases it hears first, not on appeal—is limited to cases affecting ambassadors and those in which a state is a party. Its **appellate** jurisdiction exists "with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make." So Congress may strip or limit that appellate jurisdiction.

The framers did not give the Court a general veto over legislation. They rejected a council of revision. They did not adopt a provision that would have allowed the legislature or executive to "require the opinions of the supreme Judicial Court upon important questions of law"—no advisory opinions, no role as constitutional oracle. Madison at the Convention insisted that the right of expounding the Constitution "in cases not of a judiciary nature" ought not to be given to the judicial department. The Court was expected to decide **cases**—real disputes between parties—and to apply the Constitution and laws in those disputes. It was not designed to be the single, final arbiter of constitutional meaning for the whole government. The judiciary was described as the "weakest" branch, with "neither force nor will, but merely judgment."

*Marbury* transformed that design. It claimed for the Court the power not merely to apply the Constitution in cases before it, but to declare acts of Congress void and to establish the Court's interpretation as binding on the other branches. That was a post-constitutional construction—a judicial interpretation that went beyond what the text and structure of Article III, and the expectations of the framers, had established.

## One More Voice: Scalia

For those who appreciated the late Justice Scalia's mind: he did speak to this. He rejected the standard law-school story that Marshall "invented" judicial review in a power grab. Scalia read Marshall's "it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is" not as a claim to special power but as a statement of **duty**—the Constitution is a law, and in a case properly before the Court, the Court must apply it. In that reading, there is no separate "power of judicial review"; there is only the obligation to follow the Constitution when it governs the case. The Court is the servant of the Constitution, not its shaper. That view narrows *Marbury* to the judicial sphere and leaves room for the political branches to interpret the Constitution for themselves. In *United States v. Windsor* (2013), Scalia dissented and criticized the majority for an "exalted conception of the role of this institution in America"—for aggrandizing the judiciary's role at the expense of the people's power to govern themselves. His jurisprudence has been linked to departmentalist ideas: the Court's constitutional law binds the judicial department; it does not necessarily dictate to the political branches. Scalia is not Jefferson, but his reading of *Marbury* and his skepticism of judicial aggrandizement align with the claim that the Court was never meant to be the sole arbiter of the Constitution.

## Conclusion

The Constitution and the original design of coordinate branches are antecedent to judicial supremacy. *Marbury v. Madison* did not discover that design; it distorted it. The idea that each branch interprets the Constitution within its own domain was strongly rooted at the founding and was vigorously defended by Jefferson and others in the wake of Marbury. We have spent two centuries learning to treat the Court as the final word. We have forgotten that the alternative—departmentalism—was once the live option and that it fits the text and structure of the Constitution better than judicial supremacy does.

Reclaiming that does not mean chaos. It means taking seriously the proposition that the executive and the legislature have a duty to uphold the Constitution that is not subordinated to the Court's say-so. It means asking, when a court orders the executive to do something the executive believes is beyond the court's authority or wrong on the merits: who decided the judiciary gets the last word? It means remembering that the people, in convention, were supposed to be the ultimate arbiter when the branches disagreed—not nine unelected judges.

The work of this series is to examine the Constitution from original authority—the text and the founding-era understanding—rather than from the accretion of judicial doctrine. *Marbury* is where that accretion began in earnest. It is time to subject it to the same scrutiny we apply to every other claim of power: what does the Constitution actually say? What did the framers intend? And why have we accepted, for so long, that one branch alone may answer those questions for us all?
