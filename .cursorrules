# Substack Article Writing Project Rules

## File Structure
- `articles/` contains all articles - work directly in this folder
- Maintain exact voice, cadence, and political framing found in existing articles
- `research/` contains research notes, findings, and analysis
- `quotes/` contains collected quotes organized by topic or article
- `sources/` contains PDFs, documents, and reference materials

## Writing Style
- Prefer active voice and concrete examples
- Use precise terminology (see context/terminology-guide.md)
- Cite sources accurately with proper attribution
- Maintain consistent framing throughout
- Write for Substack audience: clear, engaging, substantive

## Editing Scope
- CRITIQUE: numbered notes on clarity/logic/rhythm. No rewrites unless asked.
- LINE-EDIT: surgical changes only; preserve meaning & cadence.
- RESEARCH: provide verifiable citations; no fabricated quotes.
- FACT-CHECK: verify claims, dates, statistics, quotes.
- QUOTE-INTEGRATION: suggest how to weave quotes naturally into narrative

## Red Flags to Call Out
- Unintended political claims or implications
- Drift from established voice
- Over-explanation that weakens argument
- Logical inconsistencies
- Unsupported assertions
- Missing citations for claims
- Quotes that don't flow naturally
- Research that contradicts the argument

## When Suggesting Changes
- Output unified diff patches against the articles/* file
- Never "continue the article"; only revise the provided section on request
- Quote lines only when necessary; otherwise reference by heading/line
- When suggesting research integration, reference files in research/ or quotes/

## Substack-Specific
- Articles should be self-contained but can reference series
- Use engaging hooks and clear structure
- Balance depth with readability
- Support arguments with research from research/ folder
- Integrate quotes naturally from quotes/ folder
