# Research: What Check Does the Judiciary Have?

If checks and balances are part of our system—the executive can veto, Congress can impeach and make laws—what check exists on the judiciary?

## Formal Checks

1. **Impeachment (Article II, Section 4):** Congress can impeach and remove federal judges for "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors." In practice, impeachment has almost never been used to remove judges for their *decisions*; it is reserved for criminal or grave ethical misconduct. Jefferson called impeachment "not even a scare-crow" as a check on judicial overreach—experience had already shown it ineffective for that purpose.

2. **Jurisdiction stripping (Article III, Exceptions Clause):** "In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make." Congress can make "exceptions" to the Court's appellate jurisdiction—i.e., strip or limit it. This is a real structural check, though it has been used sparingly and is contested (e.g., *United States v. Klein* limits Congress's ability to dictate outcomes in specific cases). The Constitution does not give the Court a right to all appellate jurisdiction; Congress may regulate it.

3. **Appointments:** The President nominates; the Senate confirms. Political branches shape the Court over time. No immediate check on a particular decision.

4. **Amendment (Article V):** The people, through the amendment process, can override judicial interpretation. Difficult and slow; not a day-to-day check.

## The Departmentalist "Check"

The deeper point: if one accepts **departmentalism**, the "check" on the judiciary is that **the other branches are not bound to treat the Court's constitutional interpretations as final**. The executive and Congress have their own duty to uphold the Constitution. When the Court claims that the Constitution means X, the President or Congress may in good faith conclude it means Y and act accordingly—not as lawlessness, but as coordinate constitutional interpretation. The check is the refusal to treat the judiciary as supreme. That was Jefferson's position, and Lincoln's: the Court decides for the judicial department and for the parties before it; it does not necessarily dictate to the political branches.

So the answer to "what check does the judiciary have?" is twofold: (1) the formal mechanisms (impeachment, jurisdiction stripping, appointment, amendment) are limited in practice; (2) the constitutional design of co-equal departments implies that the real check is the political branches' independence—their right and duty to interpret the Constitution for themselves and to resist judicial supremacy when they believe the Court is wrong.

## Use in Article

A short section can note that in the standard civics story, we hear about checks on the president and Congress but rarely a clear answer to "who checks the Court?" The answer is either "almost nothing, in practice" (if we accept judicial supremacy) or "the other branches, by refusing to treat the Court as supreme and by exercising their own interpretive authority" (departmentalism). That sets up the stakes for why Marbury's self-declared supremacy is so consequential.
