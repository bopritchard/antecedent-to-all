## Marbury v. Madison: Facts and Holding

**Facts:** William Marbury and others were appointed justices of the peace in the District of Columbia by President John Adams. Commissions were signed and sealed but not delivered before Jefferson took office. Jefferson instructed Secretary of State James Madison to withhold the commissions. Marbury sued Madison in the Supreme Court, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel delivery.

**Jurisdiction:** Marbury invoked the Court's original jurisdiction under Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which authorized the Court to issue writs of mandamus.

**Marshall's move:** (1) Marshall agreed that Section 13 authorized the writ. (2) He then held that Section 13 unconstitutionally expanded the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction beyond what Article III allows. Article III gives the Court original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors and those in which a state is a party; Congress cannot add to that list. So Section 13 was void. (3) The Court therefore declined to issue the mandamus—Marbury lost. (4) In the process, Marshall announced that it is "emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is," and that a legislative act contrary to the Constitution is not law. **That is the birth of judicial review as we know it:** the Court claimed the power to refuse to apply a statute it deemed unconstitutional and to declare what the Constitution means.

**Why it matters:** The Court avoided ordering Jefferson to deliver the commission (which he might have ignored) while asserting a sweeping principle: the judiciary interprets the Constitution and may invalidate acts of Congress. One branch had awarded itself the role of final arbiter of constitutionality.

## Original Purpose of the Supreme Court (Article III)

**Article III, Section 2:** The judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties; cases affecting ambassadors; admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; controversies to which the United States is a party; between states; between a state and citizens of another state; between citizens of different states; and between a state or its citizens and foreign states or citizens.

**Original jurisdiction** (cases the Court hears first, not on appeal): only cases affecting ambassadors and those in which a state is a party. **Appellate jurisdiction** is "with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make." So Congress can strip or limit the Court's appellate jurisdiction.

**Framers' understanding:**
- Madison at the Convention (Aug. 27, 1787): He doubted extending jurisdiction "generally to cases arising Under the Constitution" and said it ought to be "limited to cases of a Judiciary Nature." "The right of expounding the Constitution in cases not of this nature ought not to be given to that Department." (Farrand, *Records of the Federal Convention*, 2:430.) The Convention agreed to "cases arising under this Constitution" but "generally supposed" jurisdiction would be "constructively limited to cases of a Judiciary nature."
- **Council of Revision rejected:** The Convention repeatedly rejected giving the judiciary a share in reviewing legislation before it took effect. No general veto over laws.
- **Advisory opinions:** A proposal to let the legislature or executive "require the opinions of the supreme Judicial Court upon important questions of law" did not make it into the Constitution. No power to pronounce on constitutional questions outside real cases.
- **Federalist 78 (Hamilton):** The judiciary is "the weakest of the three departments"; it has "neither force nor will, but merely judgment." Federalist 81 emphasized the "comparative weakness" of the judicial branch.
- **Brutus (Anti-Federalist):** Warned that the Supreme Court would be "exalted above all other power in the government, and subject to no control"—precisely the judicial-supremacy outcome that Jefferson and others later criticized.

**Implication:** The Court was intended to decide **cases and controversies** of a "judiciary nature"—disputes between parties, applying the Constitution and laws in those disputes. It was not designed to be the single, final arbiter of constitutional meaning for the whole government. Departmentalism (each branch interpreting within its sphere) fits the original design; judicial supremacy does not.

## Substantive Challenges to Marbury

**Marbury has been contested and defied; it has never been formally overruled.**

1. **Jefferson and his allies:** Strong, sustained critique. Jefferson: no word in the Constitution gives the judges exclusive power to decide constitutionality; each department is independent and has an equal right to decide for itself; the ultimate arbiter is the people in convention. (See [quotes/jefferson-judicial-power.md](../quotes/jefferson-judicial-power.md).)

2. **Andrew Jackson and Worcester v. Georgia (1832):** The Court held that Georgia's laws against the Cherokee were invalid. Jackson reportedly said (or is widely quoted as saying) something like "John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it." Whether apocryphal or not, the executive did not enforce the decision; the Court had no army. Illustrates that judicial review has no automatic enforcement—the judiciary depends on the political branches. (See [research/worcester-v-georgia-analysis.md](worcester-v-georgia-analysis.md).)

3. **Lincoln and Dred Scott (1857):** Lincoln rejected the idea that Dred Scott bound the political branches. The President and Congress, sworn to the Constitution, were not obligated to treat an erroneous Court decision as the final word. Lincoln's departmentalist stance was central to his rise and presidency.

4. **Scholarly and political challenges:** Proposals to strip the Court's jurisdiction (Article III Exceptions Clause), to limit judicial review by statute or convention, and academic work on departmentalism and coordinate construction. None has dislodged Marbury as the reigning narrative.
