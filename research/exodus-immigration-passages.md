# Research: Exodus Passages Used in Immigration Debates

## Key Exodus Passages

### Exodus 22:20
> "You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt."

**Context:** Part of the Book of the Covenant, laws given to Israel after the Ten Commandments.

**How it's used:** Cited to argue for protection of immigrants/strangers.

**Contextual issues:**
- Given to Israel as a theocratic nation under God's direct rule
- "Stranger" (ger) refers to resident aliens who lived among Israelites, not modern nation-state context
- Part of covenant law for God's people, not civil law for secular states

### Exodus 23:9
> "You shall not oppress a stranger, for you know the heart of a stranger, because you were strangers in the land of Egypt."

**Context:** Part of the same legal code, emphasizing Israel's experience as strangers.

**How it's used:** Similar to 22:20, used to argue against immigration enforcement.

**Contextual issues:**
- Same theocratic context
- "Stranger" (ger) has specific meaning in ancient Israel
- Not a command to modern nation-states

---

### Exodus 12:49
> "The same law applies to the native and to the foreigner who resides among you."

**Context:** Instructions for Passover observance.

**How it's used:** Argued to mean equality under law for all residents.

**Contextual issues:**
- Specifically about Passover observance
- "Foreigner who resides among you" (ger) - resident alien, not illegal immigrant
- Part of religious/covenant law, not modern civil law

---

### Exodus 23:11-12
> "But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave, the wild beasts may eat. In like manner you shall do with your vineyard and your olive orchard. Six days you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; that your ox and your ass may have rest, and the son of your bondmaid, and the alien may be refreshed."

**Context:** Sabbath and sabbatical year laws.

**How it's used:** Argued to show inclusion of strangers in social provisions.

**Contextual issues:**
- Part of sabbatical year and Sabbath laws
- "Alien" (ger) - resident alien, specific category
- Agricultural/economic laws for theocratic Israel

## How These Are Used in Modern Debates

### Left/Progressive Usage
- Cited to argue against immigration enforcement
- Used to demand state action on behalf of immigrants
- Claimed as biblical mandate for open borders or amnesty
- Presented as commands to modern nation-states

### Problems with This Usage
1. **Context mismatch:** Theocratic Israel vs. modern secular states
2. **Term mismatch:** "Ger" (resident alien) vs. modern "immigrant"
3. **Authority mismatch:** Covenant law for God's people vs. civil law for all citizens
4. **Role mismatch:** Instructions to God's people vs. commands to the state

## The Real Question

These are good and necessary instructions **for God's people**:
- Christians should care for strangers
- Christians should not oppress
- Christians should include the vulnerable
- Christians should practice hospitality

But:
- How did these become commands to the **state**?
- Where is the biblical mandate to **offload these onto government**?
- Why should **non-kingdom people** be compelled to fund and participate?

## Sources to Consult

- Biblical commentaries on Exodus
- Ancient Near Eastern legal context
- Hebrew word studies (ger, etc.)
- Theocratic vs. secular state distinctions
- Church vs. state role distinctions
