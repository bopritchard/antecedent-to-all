# Research: Scalia on Judicial Review and Marbury v. Madison

## Scalia's Reading of Marbury

Justice Antonin Scalia did speak on this topic. He rejected the standard law-school narrative that Marshall "invented" judicial review in a power grab.

**His view (per SCOTUSblog tribute by Lee Liberman Otis, former clerk):**
- Marshall's "it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is" was not primarily about **judicial power** but about **judicial obligation** (judicial duty).
- The Constitution is a **law**; in a case properly before the Court, the Court must apply it like any other law. No special "power of judicial review"—only the duty to apply the Constitution when it governs the case.
- The Court as **servant** of the Constitution, not its **shaper**.

**Use in article:** Scalia's reading narrows Marbury to "courts apply the Constitution in cases before them" rather than "the Court is the final arbiter of constitutional meaning for all branches." That aligns with departmentalism: the Court binds itself and the judicial department; it does not necessarily bind the political branches. (Chicago Law Review has discussed "Originalist Law Reform, Judicial Departmentalism, and Justice Scalia.")

## Windsor Dissent: "Exalted Conception"

In *United States v. Windsor* (2013), Scalia dissented and criticized the majority for an **"exalted conception of the role of this institution in America."** The majority had asserted the judiciary's "primary role in determining the constitutionality of a law" and that this role must not "become only secondary to the President's." Scalia rejected that aggrandizement: prioritizing the Court's desire to pronounce on constitutional questions over separation of powers **diminished the people's power to govern themselves**.

**Use in article:** Optional quote or paraphrase—Scalia explicitly pushed back on the idea that the judiciary has a "primary" role in constitutional determination vis-à-vis the President, consistent with coordinate construction.
